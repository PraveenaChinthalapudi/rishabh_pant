        India was bowled out for 36 in the second innings of the first Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2020â€“21 and hence lost the test by 8 wickets despite getting a healthy first-innings lead.
        <br>Following this, Rishabh Pant was picked ahead of Wriddhiman Saha for the second test in Melbourne.

        <br>While Pant scored a valuable[why?] 29 in the first innings of the Melbourne Test,it was at Sydney that he played a career-changing knock.[64] With 97 overs to survive on the last day, he played a counter-attacking knock of 97 runs off just 118 balls, also putting up a 148-run partnership with Cheteshwar Pujara.
        <br>The match ultimately ended in a draw.
        
        <br>India had a bunch of first-choice players unavailable due to injury and were the underdogs going into the match played in The Gabba were Australia had not been defeated since 1988.
        <br>Pant put in a match-winning performance on day five, as India chased down a target of 328 in the fourth innings, scoring an unbeaten 89.
        
        <br>In September 2021, Pant was named in India's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.
        <br>At the annual ICC Awards in January 2022, Pant was named in ICC Men's Test Team of the Year for the year 2021.[74] In March 2022, during the second match against Sri Lanka, Pant scored the fastest half-century by a batter for India in a Test match, breaking the record previously held by Kapil Dev.
        <br>He brought up his half-century in just 28 deliveries.
